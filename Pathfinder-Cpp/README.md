# Pathfinder C++ Port
This is a port of the C core libraries and uses the same API. The purpose
of this port is for C++ projects that will be run across multiple architectures
or where you want to compile it yourself for some reason. Note that this is NOT
for use in C++ robot applications, for that you always have the same target architecture
(the RoboRIO). For that, add the compiled binaries per the instructions in the main page.
